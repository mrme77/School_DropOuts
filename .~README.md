## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. Below are the libraries used for this project.
```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error
import AllTogether as t
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
```

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using syintethic data inspired from a Kaggle dataset to accomplish the following:
1. What Family Factors Contribute to Student Dropout Rates?
2. Do Extracurricular Activities Reduce the Likelihood of Dropping Out?
3. Does Access to Educational Support Systems Help Prevent Dropout?
4. How Does Alcohol Consumption Relate to Student Dropout?
5. What ML model can we use to predicate DropOuts?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 jupyter notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. It is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  
Hereâ€™s a table explaining each of the fields from the dataset (student_data.csv)

This table should help you understand each field's role and what kind of data it contains.
There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.
